    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Spatio-Temporal distribution of burned areas (BA) is critical for understanding fire dynamics and their ecological, climatic, and socio-economic impacts. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of burned area estimates derived from major global datasets including FireCCI51 and MCD64.</p>
    <p>Custom developed algorithms implemented in GEE facilitate the comparison of products ensuring consistent and accurate assessments. The findings provide insights into the variability and reliability of BA datasets, highlighting implications for their use in fire management.</p>
